### General info

This repository contains code, conda environments, and step-by-instructions to reproduce the analysis published in [Perino et al, 2018](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/29808031)

Minor differences in the results and from the original 2018 code might be present as this repository has been created post-publication in 2022.

To reproduce the analysis install the conda environment `envs/Perino_2018.yml` and follow the instructions in the notebooks/html files in `src/notebooks`
All notebooks are meant to be run with with the environment `envs/Perino_2018.yml` installed and activated. 
Environments with `*snakemake*` in the name are required for running the snakemake pipelines but do not need to be installed manually.
